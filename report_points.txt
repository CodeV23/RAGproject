Enter your question: animatronic called springtrap attraction

[ANSWER]
 The animatronic called Springtrap is based on a character from a closed family restaurant (Freddy Fazbear's Pizza) and is part of the horror-themed attraction Fazbear's Fright.
[TOTAL TIME] 107.455s

2. LSH retrieval initially failed because high similarity thresholds (0.5) are unsuitable for long natural-language chunks with sparse lexical overlap.
Lowering the threshold (≈ 0.05) enables matches to appear, confirming correct bucket formation.
This illustrates LSH’s sensitivity to set-size imbalance and motivates hybrid or embedding-based improvements in later stages.


3. With a threshold of 0.5, 

(RAGenv) C:\code\python\RAGproject>python -u "c:\code\python\RAGproject\src\LSHRAG.py"
=== LSH RAG Benchmark ===

Enter your question: animatronic called springtrap attraction
[WARN] No matches found via LSH; returning top-1 random chunk.

[ANSWER]
 Springtrap is an animatronic in the context of Five Nights at Freddy's 3.
[TOTAL TIME] 9.073s

But with a threshold of 0.05,


(RAGenv) C:\code\python\RAGproject>python -u "c:\code\python\RAGproject\src\LSHRAG.py"
=== LSH RAG Benchmark ===
[INFO] Loaded 2 docs → 19 chunks
[TIMER] Document loading & chunking: 0.006s

[INFO] Indexed 19 documents with LSH.
[TIMER] Embedding skipped (LSH indexing only): 0.173s
[MEMORY] Before: 374.84 MB | After: 376.66 MB | Peak: 0.27 MB

Enter your question: animatronic called springtrap attraction
[INFO] Found 7 matching buckets via LSH → ['doc_2', 'doc_13', 'doc_1', 'doc_6', 'doc_7']

[ANSWER]
 The animatronic called Springtrap is found in a horror-themed attraction based on Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, as mentioned in the context provided.
[TOTAL TIME] 115.123s

This clearly demonstrates that at 0.05 it basically degenerates into brute force searching.

4. At a threshold of 0.5, we can reduce num_perm shortens every signature and speeds up both index building and querying (at a tiny cost in accuracy).
Trying the value of num_perm=32:

(RAGenv) C:\code\python\RAGproject>python -u "c:\code\python\RAGproject\src\LSHRAG.py"
=== LSH RAG Benchmark ===
[INFO] Loaded 2 docs → 19 chunks
[TIMER] Document loading & chunking: 0.006s
[INFO] Building LSH index...
[INFO] Indexed 19 documents with LSH.
[TIMER] Embedding skipped (LSH indexing only): 0.084s
[MEMORY] Before: 374.41 MB | After: 376.79 MB | Peak: 0.13 MB

Enter your question: animatronic called springtrap attraction
[WARN] No matches found via LSH; returning top-1 random chunk.

[ANSWER]
 Springtrap is an animatronic in the game "Five Nights at Freddy's 3."
[TOTAL TIME] 8.967s


For a longer corpus, the difference could be seen more evidently.


5. ALthough its not mentioned in the paper, Bigram tokenization (shingles) could potentially be helpful in improving efficiency.

(RAGenv) C:\code\python\RAGproject>python -u "c:\code\python\RAGproject\src\LSHRAG.py"
=== LSH RAG Benchmark ===
[INFO] Loaded 3 docs → 190 chunks
[TIMER] Document loading & chunking: 0.074s
[INFO] Building LSH index...
[INFO] Indexed 190 documents with LSH.
[TIMER] Embedding skipped (LSH indexing only): 2.570s
[MEMORY] Before: 374.53 MB | After: 380.25 MB | Peak: 2.54 MB

Enter your question: animatronic called springtrap attraction
[WARN] No matches found via LSH; returning top-1 random chunk.

[ANSWER]
 Springtrap is an animatronic in the game "Five Nights at Freddy's 3".
[TOTAL TIME] 5.557s

6. for moving onto the next stages of reasoning, we should utilise parameters that allow for at least one bucket to fire, so a reasonable 
answer can be retrieved. However, the buckets still fail to fire outside of very small values of threshold which degenerate into brute force searching.
In this experiment, MinHash-based LSH achieved strong indexing efficiency but failed to retrieve semantically relevant text beyond near-duplicates, demonstrating its limitation for open-domain RAG.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. Next we tried adding ReAct to the mix, and it really didnt quite help. The agent was told to follow a classic thought action observation workflow,
and the index building went as follows

[MEMORY] Before: 71.21 MB | After: 76.88 MB | Peak: 2.75 MB
[TOTAL TIME] 0.300s

and the model itself outputs:

 The observation        │
│ discusses the hunting behavior of          │
│ cats and their interactions with                     │
│ humans. According to the text,   │
│ domestic cats often bring home prey        │
│ and share it with their human              │
│ guardians as if they were part   │
│ of the cat's social group        │
│ (source:                                                                 │
│ data\raw\cat.txt#2
│ l8120-2972
│ 25h0). This behavior may be due  │
│ to the cats perceiving humans    │
│ as high in the dominance                   │
│ hierarchy or as a method for               │
│ teaching humans to hunt or                           │
│ assisting them, such as feeding  │
│ an elderly cat or an                                 │
│ inept kitten (source:  │
│ data\raw\cat.txt#2
│ l8120-2972
│ 25h0). However, this hypothesis            │
│ is inconsistent with male cats             │
│ also bringing home prey, as they │
│ have negligible involvement in raising     │
│ kittens. The observation also    │
│ mentions that domestic male cats           │
│ are more likely to fight than              │
│ females due to competition for                       │
│ mating or establishing                                         │
│ territories, and fighting behavior         │
│ can be decreased or eliminated             │
│ by neutering (source:                      │
│ data\raw\cat.txt#2
│ l8120-2972
│ 25h0).                                                                                       │
│                                                                                                        │
│                                                                                              │

clearly the context is random, and it took almost 37 minutes to run. so, we decided to return to the ANN handling to speed up the model.

-----------------------------------------------

8. We look into Hierarchial Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs next. being a much bigger step up from LSH using dense embeddings,
building the index gives the output:
